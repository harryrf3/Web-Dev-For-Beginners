# Use HTML the way it was desgined

Using fancy work arounds such as using `<span>` for `<button>` or `<a>` creates confusion when relying on a screen reader.

>As a best practice, you should always use the appropriate HTML when creating controls on a page. If you want a hyperlink, use `<a>`, or use `<button>` for a button.
  

**Important**

Keyboard navigation needs to be tested manually, and you should do it on every page that you create. **[WebAIM](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/)** has more information about keyboard navigation strategies.
