## Use HTML the way it was desgined

Using fancy work arounds such as using `<span>` for `<button>` or `<a>` creates confusion when relying on a screen reader.

>As a best practice, you should always use the appropriate HTML when creating controls on a page. If you want a hyperlink, use `<a>`, or use `<button>` for a button.
  

**Important**

Keyboard navigation needs to be tested manually, and you should do it on every page that you create. **[WebAIM](https://webaim.org/techniques/keyboard/)** has more information about keyboard navigation strategies.


## Challenge
The best way to understand how to make pages accessible, and the impact of the decisions that you make when creating HTML, is to use some of the tools that users use to browse the web.

Move through a couple of pages by using a screen reader. Open a website that has a form and use only your keyboard to complete it. This activity will give you a sense of what some users experience on a daily basis when using the web, and the importance of ensuring that your pages are accessible.
